## Creating deployment

1. Install required packages
2. Create `docker-compose.yml` from `docker-compose example.yml`
3. Place your API keys inside your newly created `docker-compose.yml`.

    ```yml
    OPENAI_API_KEY: <YOUR-API-KEY-HERE>
    LANGSMITH_API_KEY: <YOUR-API-KEY-HERE>
    ```

4. Change your current directory to `deployment`

    ```cmd
    cd deployment
    ```

5. Create an image for your deployment

    ```cmd
    langgraph build -t my-image
    ```

6. If everything is working, lauch the deployment. (If you already built the image, just do this command immediately)

    ```cmd
    docker-compose up
    ```

7. To stop docker:

    ```cmd
    docker-compose down
    ```

## Viewing your Deployed Graph

- API: http://localhost:8123
- Docs: http://localhost:8123/docs
- Langgraph Studio: https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:8123

__PS__: you may change the API url by changing the port inside the `.yml` file
